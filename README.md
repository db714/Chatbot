Career-Finding Chatbot

A chatbot that asks questions based on various skills and interests.  The bot then takes those answers and suggests various career paths within computer science and then provides links with more information on the subject.

The chatbot was written in the AIML language and deployed on pandorabots.com

Future implementations include:
-Deploying the bot on other outlets such as web, messaging apps(twitter,messenger,etc.)
-Making the bot more detailed and ask more questions as well as provide more information on the topic.
